GIPHY Party is a browser app that allows you to browse GIPHY's vast gif library for any images you might be searching for!

The app will pull a random gif that fits your search every time, except:
- If GIPHY sends a duplicate gif.
- If your search returned no results.

In these cases, the app will let you know. Give it a try here: https://acollino.github.io/giphy-party/

This app was created in VSCode using minor starter HTML code from Springboard. It uses the Axios API to manage AJAX requests and uses the GIPHY API to access its gif library (utilizing the random endpoint and following its attribution guidelines).
